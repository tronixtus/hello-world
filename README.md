# hello-world
another repository


This is a repository I made for my systems programming class.
My name's Troy, at the moment Im a software engineering student at UTD.
Ive got experience in Java C++ and C#, though I have done a couple classes in assembly and etc.

I havent quite gotten that urge to tinker yet, but its only a metter of time before I
find some thing I want get done and start coding.
